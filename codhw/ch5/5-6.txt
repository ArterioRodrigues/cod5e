5.6.1) 
Clock rate for P1 = 1 / 0.66e-9 = 1.51GHz
Clock rate for P2 = 1 / 0.9e-9 = 1.11GHz

5.6.2)
Average memory access time for P1 = 0.66e-9 + 8% * 70e-9 = 6.26ns
Average memory access time for P2 = 0.9e-9 + 6% * 70e-9 = 5.1ns

5.6.3)
Total CPI = Base CPI + (# of memory access instructions / # of instructions) * [(Primary stalls per instruction) + (Secondary stalls per 
instruction)]

Where for P1:
	- Base CPI = 1
	- # of memory access instructions / # of instructions = 0.36
	- miss rate = 0.08
	- miss penalty cycles = miss penalty cycle time * clock rate = 70ns * 1.51GHz

Thus, 
	total CPI for P1 = 1 + (0.36) * (0.08 * 70 / 0.66) = 4.054 CPI
	total CPI for P2 = 1 + (0.36) * (0.06 * 70 / 0.90) = 2.68 CPI

Making P2 4.054 / 2.68 = 1.512 times faster than P1.

5.6.4) 
Average Time to Access Memory, AMAT = hit time + miss rate * miss penalty

AMAT with L2 = 0.66ns + 8% * (L2 hit + L2 miss)
	     = 0.66ns + 8% * [5.62ns + 95% * 70ns]
	     = 0.66ns + 8% * [5.62ns + 66.5ns]
	     = 0.66ns + 5.7696
	     = 6.4296ns

eg, AMAT has become worse by adding a second cache. 

5.6.5)
Total CPI = Base CPI + (# of memory access instructions / # of instructions) * (Primary stalls per instruction + Secondary stalls per 
														          instruction) 
          = 1 + 0.36 * [(0.08 * 6.26 / 0.66) + (0.95 * 6.4296 /Â 0.66)]
          = 4.604 average clocks per instruction

5.6.6) 

P2 is still faster (4.604 CPI vs 2.68 CPI). 

The miss rate would need to be 
L1 miss rate = (Total CPI - Base CPI)/[(# of memory access instructions / # of instructions) * (L2 hit time in cycles + L2 miss penalty 
in cycles)]
             = (2.68 - 1)/(0.36 * (5.62ns + 95% * 70ns) * 1.51GHz)
             = 0.0428 or 4.28%, about half of what is now (8%).
