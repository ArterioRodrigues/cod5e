Yes. Branches address -2^15 to 2^15 - 1 words (or -2^17 to 2^17 - 4 bytes) relative to PC+4 

So, if current PC is 0x1FFF0000 the maximum address in PC would be:

0x1FFF0000 + 0x4    +    0x20000 - 0x4 = 0x2001F000  --->  that is more than the desired address of 0x20014924
(    PC + 4    )         (  2^17 - 4 )
