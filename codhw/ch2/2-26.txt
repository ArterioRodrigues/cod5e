5*N + 2 (the last two being the last if(i == 0) comparsion at
the end of the loop). 
Also note that `subi` is a pseudo-instruction,
so 5*N + 2 is assuming the `subi` will be assembled as a single
`addi $t1, $t1, <immediate>` instruction. Some assemblers, like
the one present in MARS, will expand `subi` into two instructions.
In that case, the correct answer would be `6*N + 2`.
